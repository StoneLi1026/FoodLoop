# Firebase Integration - FoodLoop

## Overview
This document outlines the Firebase backend integration implemented for the FoodLoop app, replacing mock data with real Firestore database and Firebase Authentication.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Firebase Data Models
- **FirebaseModels.swift**: Complete data models for Firebase compatibility
- **FirebaseFoodItem**: Food items with geolocation support using GeoFireUtils
- **FirebaseUser**: User profiles with stats, badges, and challenges
- **ShareType Enum**: Structured sharing types (ÂÖçË≤ª, ÂÑ™ÊÉ†, ÊçêË¥à)

### 2. Firebase Manager Service
- **FirebaseManager.swift**: Centralized service for all Firebase operations
- User creation and real-time sync with Authentication
- Food item CRUD operations with location-based queries
- Real-time listeners for data updates
- Automatic user stats and points tracking

### 3. Authentication Flow
- **LoginView.swift**: Updated to create/sync user data in Firestore after Google Sign-In
- **UserProfileModel.swift**: Real-time Firebase sync with authentication state
- Automatic user creation with default badges and challenges

### 4. Location-Based Features
- **ExploreView.swift**: Location-based food discovery with radius filtering
- **UploadView.swift**: Automatic location tagging for food items
- **LocationManager**: Core Location integration for user positioning
- **GeoFireUtils**: Geographic queries for nearby food items

### 5. Enhanced UI Features
- Share type filtering (Free, Discounted, Donation)
- Real-time data updates across all views
- Loading states and error handling
- Upload progress indicators

### 6. Security & Privacy
- **firestore.rules**: Comprehensive security rules
- User data privacy protection
- Admin role-based access control
- Data validation and spam prevention

- Points and statistics tracking
- Badge and challenge system
- Authentication state management
```

### Food Item Management
```swift
- Location-based food discovery
- Share type filtering (Free, Discounted, Donation)
- Real-time updates across users
- Automatic distance calculations
```

### Location Integration
```swift
- GPS-based food discovery
- Geohash indexing for efficient queries
- Radius-based filtering (default 10km)
- Location permission handling
```

## üì± Updated Views

### ExploreView
- Added share type filter chips
- Location-based food loading
- Real-time data updates
- Enhanced filtering system

### UploadView  
- Firebase integration for food uploads
- Automatic location tagging
- User profile integration
- Upload progress feedback

### ProfileView (UserProfileModel)
- Real-time Firebase sync
- Authentication state handling
- Automatic user creation
- Points and statistics tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Firestore Rules
- User data privacy (users can only access their own data)
- Public food item reading (authenticated users)
- Upload restrictions (only authenticated users)
- Admin role-based access
- Data validation and spam prevention

### Data Validation
- Required field validation
- Geographic coordinate bounds checking
- Share type enumeration validation
- Timestamp and user ID verification

## üß™ Testing Integration

### To Test Firebase Integration:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign in with Google
   - Verify user creation in Firestore
   - Check real-time profile sync

2. **Food Upload**
   - Create new food item
   - Verify location tagging
   - Check real-time updates in ExploreView

3. **Location Features**
   - Grant location permission
   - Test nearby food discovery
   - Verify distance calculations

4. **Filtering System**
   - Test share type filters (Free, Discounted, Donation)
   - Verify real-time filter updates
   - Check location-based results

### Database Collections

#### users
```
- uid (string)
- name (string)  
- email (string)
- share_count (number)
- receive_count (number)
- points (number)
- badges (array)
- challenges (array)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

#### food_items
```
- name (string)
- category (string)
- uploader_id (string)
- share_type (string)
- expiry_date (timestamp)
- latitude (number)
- longitude (number)
- geohash (string)
- is_active (boolean)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2 Implementation
1. **Image Storage**: Firebase Storage integration for food photos
2. **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for new food alerts
3. **Chat System**: Real-time messaging between users
4. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior and food waste tracking
5. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline capabilities

### Production Deployment
1. Deploy Firestore security rules
2. Configure Firebase project settings
3. Set up Firebase indexes for optimal performance
4. Enable Firebase Analytics
5. Configure Firebase App Check for security

## üîó Dependencies Added
- Firebase iOS SDK v11.14.0
- GeoFireUtils for location queries
- Core Location for GPS functionality
- Firebase Firestore for database
- Firebase Authentication for user management

All UI components and user experience remain identical while now powered by real Firebase backend infrastructure.
